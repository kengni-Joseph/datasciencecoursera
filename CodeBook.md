"CodeBook for Tidy Dataset from the UCI HAR Dataset Project"

2. Introduction
Provide a brief description of the purpose of your project and the dataset being analyzed. Mention the source of the original data and the overall goal of the analysis.

Example: > This CodeBook describes the variables, data structure, and transformations applied to create the tidy dataset from the UCI HAR Dataset. The dataset contains measurements from smartphone accelerometers, and this analysis aims to create a clean, tidy dataset summarizing the average values of selected features for each activity and subject.

3. Source of Data
Document where the raw data came from, including the dataset URL or name, and a brief description of its origin.

Example:

Source: UCI HAR Dataset

Link: Dataset Download Link

Description: The original dataset was collected from smartphone sensors worn by participants during specific activities.

4. Variables and Descriptions
List all the variables in your tidy dataset, along with clear descriptions. Include:

Variable name: The column name in the tidy dataset.

Description: What the variable represents.

Units: The unit of measurement, if applicable.

Example:

Variable Name	Description	Units
subject	Unique identifier for each participant in the study.	N/A
activity	The activity being performed during data collection.	N/A
TimeBodyAccMeanX	Average body acceleration signal in the X direction.	Standardized (g)
TimeBodyAccMeanY	Average body acceleration signal in the Y direction.	Standardized (g)
TimeBodyAccMeanZ	Average body acceleration signal in the Z direction.	Standardized (g)
FrequencyBodyGyroMeanX	Average body gyroscope signal in the X direction.	Radians/sec
5. Transformations and Cleaning Steps
Explain how the raw data was processed to produce the tidy dataset. Include any key transformations, filters, or cleaning steps applied.

Example:

Merging datasets: Combined the training and test datasets to form a single dataset.

Selecting relevant variables: Extracted only variables measuring mean and standard deviation.

Renaming variables: Replaced abbreviations with descriptive names (e.g., Acc â†’ Accelerometer).

Activity labels: Replaced activity codes with descriptive activity names.

Summarizing data: Calculated the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.

6. Dataset Information
Describe the structure of the final tidy dataset:

Number of rows: (e.g., "The dataset contains 180 rows, corresponding to 30 subjects and 6 activities.")

Number of columns: (e.g., "The dataset contains 68 variables, including subject, activity, and averaged measurements.")

Format: (e.g., "The dataset is saved as a text file named tidy_data.txt.")

7. Usage Instructions
Include any special notes about using the dataset or recreating it with the script.

Example: > The dataset can be loaded into R using the following command: > R > data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt", header = TRUE) >
